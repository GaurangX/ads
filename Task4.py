TASK 4:
The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing
telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers:
these are numbers that make outgoing calls but never send texts,
receive texts or receive incoming calls.

Print a message:

The list of numbers should be print out one per line in lexicographic order with no duplicates.

Run time complexity:
  - find_telem: The for loops iterate over list of calls and texts respectively.
  They can be O(n) and O(m) where n is length  of calls and m is lengths of texts.
  It also has another loop that iterates over a call_tx list O(p) and the if
  condition checks for a number in concatenated list of call_ex and text O(q).
  That for loop has overall complexity of O(p*q). List append operations are O(1).
  - unique_telem: Iterates over list O(n) and creates a hash table O(1).
  - sort_and_print: An in place sort operation over a list O(n log n). And the
  for loop iterates over a sorted list O(m).
