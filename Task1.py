TASK 1:
How many different telephone numbers are there in the records?

"""
Run time complexity:
  - get_freq has a for loop iterating over length of texts (a list of n
  lines from texts.csv) and another list of calls (a list of m lines from
  calls.csv). TIme complexities of those loops are of O(n) and O(m) respectively.
  Whithin each loop if condition checks a hashtable (python dictionary)
  called "phone_numbers". The worst case look up time is of O(1) and hence they
  do not contribute to the complexity of for loops.
  - find unique function iterates over the dictionary of length n items. Time
  complexity of this operation would be O(n). List append is O(1)
  - Aligns with python profile output:
