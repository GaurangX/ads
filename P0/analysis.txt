Task0:
The run time complexity of accessing python list is O(1) get length is also O(1)

Task1:
- get_freq has a for loop iterating over length of texts (a list of n
      lines from texts.csv) and another list of calls (a list of m lines from
          calls.csv). TIme complexities of those loops are of O(n) and O(m) respectively.
        Whithin each loop if condition checks a hashtable (python dictionary)
    called "phone_numbers". The worst case look up time is of O(1) and hence they
      do not contribute to the complexity of for loops.
        - find unique function iterates over the dictionary of length n items. Time
          complexity of this operation would be O(n). List append is O(1)
    - Aligns with python profile output.

Task2:
- call_duration iterates over list of calls. That for loop is O(n).
- Within for loop the if conditions check for items in a dictionary. Python
hashtable look up is O(1) profiler does not show any hash conflicts.
- Find_longest function uses max over a list. Time complextiy of max operation
is o(n). It is also iterating over a list O(n).

Task3:
- extract_cx_rx: Iterates over a list of calls, which is O(n). On top of that
the string slice is basically a copy and would do O(m), where m is the
length of string. Comparing to area code is O(1). Builds a default dict representing
one to many hash table.
- extract_codes: iterates over a defaultdict O(n). Regex is basically a string
matching. And the complexity can be O(m), where m is the length of string. The internal
for loop is iterating over a list (value in default dict) O(p), where p is the length of
the list.
- Find_unique: Basically iterating over a list of codes O(n) and addint it to a
hash table O(1).
- sort_and_print: Python's inplace sort method is O(n log n). Printing
iterates over a list O(n).
- Find_fix2fix: Iterates over a list O(n). Slicing of the string is O(m), m is
length of string.

Task4:
- find_telem: The for loops iterate over list of calls and texts respectively.
  They can be O(n) and O(m) where n is length  of calls and m is lengths of texts.
  It also has another loop that iterates over a call_tx list O(p) and the if
  condition checks for a number in concatenated list of call_ex and text O(q).
  That for loop has overall complexity of O(p*q). List append operations are O(1).
  - unique_telem: Iterates over list O(n) and creates a hash table O(1).
  - sort_and_print: An in place sort operation over a list O(n log n). And the
  for loop iterates over a sorted list O(m).
